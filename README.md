# Rash Driving Detection using CNN + LSTM

This deep learning project detects rash driving behavior from dashcam videos using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model processes video frames and classifies the driving pattern as either "rash" or "normal".

## Model Summary

- CNN extracts spatial features from each frame.
- LSTM captures temporal driving behavior across frames.
- The final prediction indicates whether the input video shows rash driving.

## Dataset

The dataset contains dashcam video clips categorized as:
- `rash/` â€“ Aggressive or unsafe driving
- `normal/` â€“ Smooth, safe driving
